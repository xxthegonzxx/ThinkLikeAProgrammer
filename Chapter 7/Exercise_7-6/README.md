# Exercise 7-6

Suppose you are working on a project in which a particular *studentRecord* may need to be augmented with one of the following pieces of data: term paper title, year of enrollment, or a *bool* indicating whether the student is auditing the class. You won't want to include all of these data fields in the base *studentRecord* class/struct, knowing that in most cases they won't be used. Your first thought is to create three subclasses/structs, each having one of the data fields, with names such as *studentRecordTitle*, *studentRecordYear*, and *studentRecordAudit*. Then you are informed that some student records will contain two of these additional data fields or perhaps all three. Creating subclasses/structs for each possible variation is impractical. Find a design pattern that addresses this conundrim, and implement a solution.
