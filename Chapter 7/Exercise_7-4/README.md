# Exercise 7-4

For the problem in 7-3, implement a solution by implementing an abstract data type that allows an arbitrary number of items to be stored and individual records to be retrieved based on a key value. A generic term for a structure that can efficiently store and retrieve items based on a key value is a *symbol table*, and common implementations of the symbol table idea are *hash tables* and *binary search trees*.
