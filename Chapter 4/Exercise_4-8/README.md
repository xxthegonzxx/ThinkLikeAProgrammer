# Exercise 4-8

Add a function to the linked-list string implementation called *removeChars* to remove a section of characters from a string based on the position and length. For example, *removeChars(s1, 5, 3)* would remove the three characters starting at the fifth character in the string. Make sure the removed nodes are properly deallocated.
