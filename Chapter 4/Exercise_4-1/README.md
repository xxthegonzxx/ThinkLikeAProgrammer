# Exercise 4-1

Design your own: Take a problem that you already know how to solve using an array but that is limited by the size of the array. Rewrite the code to remove that limitation using a dynamically allocated array.

**Note:** *Since go already has dynamically allocated slices this challenge will instead focus on working with linked lists.*
