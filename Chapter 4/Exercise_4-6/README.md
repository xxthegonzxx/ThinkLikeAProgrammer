# Exercise 4-6

Let's create an implementation for strings that uses a linked list of characters instead of dynamically allocated arrays. So we'll have a linked list where the data payload is a single char; this will allow strings to grow without having to recreate the entire string. We'll start by implementing the *append* and *characterAt* functions.
