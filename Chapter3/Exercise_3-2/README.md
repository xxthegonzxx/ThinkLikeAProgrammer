# Exercise 3-2

Rewrite the code that finds the agent with the best monthly sales average so that it finds the agent with the highest `median` sales. The median of a set of values is the "one in the middle", such that half of the values are higher and half of the other values are lower. If there is an even number of values, the median is the simple average of the two values in the middle. For example, in the set 10, 6, 2, 14, 7, 9, the values in the middle are 7 and 9. The average of 7 and 9 is 8, so 8 is the median.

## Tip

To find the median:

- Arrange the data points from smallest to largest.
  
- If the number of data points is odd, the median is the middle data point in the list.
  
- If the number of data points is even, the median is the average of the two middle data points in the list.
