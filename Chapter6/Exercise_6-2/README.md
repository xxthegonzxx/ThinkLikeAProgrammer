# Exercise 6-2

Consider an array representing a binary string, where every element's data value is 0 or 1. Write a *bool* function to determine whether the binary string has odd parity (an odd number of 1 bits). **HINT**: Remember that the recursive function is going to return true (odd) or false (even), not the count of 1 bits. Solve the problem first using iteration, then recursion.
